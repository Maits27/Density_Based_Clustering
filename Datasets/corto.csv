2,"Ex Wife Threatening SuicideRecently I left my wife for good because she has cheated on me twice and lied to me so much that I have decided to refuse to go back to her. As of a few days ago, she began threatening suicide. I have tirelessly spent these paat few days talking her out of it and she keeps hesitating because she wants to believe I'll come back. I know a lot of people will threaten this in order to get their way, but what happens if she really does? What do I do and how am I supposed to handle her death on my hands? I still love my wife but I cannot deal with getting cheated on again and constantly feeling insecure. I'm worried today may be the day she does it and I hope so much it doesn't happen.",suicide

9,"I’m so lostHello, my name is Adam (16) and I’ve been struggling for years and I’m afraid. Through these past years thoughts of suicide, fear, anxiety I’m so close to my limit . I’ve been quiet for so long and I’m too scared to come out to my family about these feelings. About 3 years ago  losing my aunt triggered it all. Everyday feeling hopeless , lost, guilty, and remorseful over her and all the things I’ve done in my life,but thoughts like these with the little I’ve experienced in life? Only time I’ve revealed these feelings to my family is when I broke down where they saw my cuts. Watching them get so worried over something I portrayed as an average day made me feel absolutely dreadful. They later found out I was an attempt survivor from attempt OD(overdose from pills) and attempt hanging. All that happened was a blackout from the pills and I never went through with the noose because I’m still so afraid. During my first therapy I was diagnosed with severe depression, social anxiety, and a eating disorder.
I was later transferred to a fucken group therapy for some reason which made me feel more anxious. Eventually before my last session with a 1 on 1 therapy she showed me my results from a daily check up on my feelings(which was a 2 - step survey for me and my mom/dad )
Come to find out as I’ve been putting feeling horrible and afraid/anxious everyday , my mom has been doing I’ve been doing absolutely amazing with me described as “happiest she’s ever seen me, therapy has helped him” 
I eventually was put on Sertaline (anti anxiety or anti depression I’m sorry I forgot) but I never finished my first prescription nor ever found the right type of anti depressant because my mom thought I only wanted the drugs so she took me off my recommended pill schedule after ~3 week and stopped me from taking them. All this time I’ve been feeling worse afraid of the damage/ worry I’ve caused them even more. 
Now here with everything going on, I’m as afraid as I’ve ever been . I’ve relapsed on cutting and have developed severe insomnia . Day after day feeling more hopeless, worthless questioning why am I still here? What’s my motivation to move out of bed and keep going? I ask these to myself nearly every night almost having a break down everytime. 
Please Please Please someone.. anyone help me.

11,"Honetly idkI dont know what im even doing here. I just feel like there is nothing and nowhere for me. All i can feel is either nothing or unbearably sad. Im ignoring friends every opitunity i can. I feel like im loosing my girlfriend. I only hurt everyone i talk too and i dont cause anything good. Im behind on my education, i feel alone but for the first time its not a feeling ive enjoyed. I have no hopes or dreams. I care about nothing, not family, not friends, not even my girlfriend (i still love her, its complicated and i dont have the words to describe it). 

I would do something to end myself but i know im not strong and brave enough to do it, and knowing im that weak makes me sadder. The only thing i can do is push away all emotion and be empty, because as bad as it is im used to it, its my way of being normal. 

I dont understand how people have hopes or dreams, and i mentioned how bad i was feeling to my girlfriend but she just got scared i would die so i havnt brought it up again. But in that talk i realised i cant even comprehend my life having meaning to anyone.

I know this is just me rambling and i will probably regret posting this as ill think im taking the place of someone having a worse time with a gun to their head. I encoage all people who see this to help them instead of me. Ill probably suvive, they might not. Plus my life is meaningless and my future bleak, while they could cure cancer or something useful.

He's seen my at my worst - but! I had always only cut on my ankles and wrists, I'm thinking the excuse for this would be easier than one for cuts.


 I did work on my car last night and I hadn't self harmed in a LONG time. I just did it without thinking, as usual; impulse and lost in the moment.


Should I say I touched something under the hood while the car was still hot? I have 3 almost in a curved like pattern the first on forearm then down a little then on the side of my wrist. They are about an inch long, kind of wide and a little deep. 

I think the car excuse  is a good one but I would need to say what I was working on to explain the 3 burns. Maybe that there was a wire smooshed behind the engine and when I went to fix it I touched the engine?

18,"My life is over at 20 years oldHello all. I am a 20 year old balding male. My hairline is trash and to make matters worse my head is HUGE. I have bipolar, depression and crippling social anxiety.

I’ve been arrested numerous times, been in rehab, mental hospitals, you name it. The only reason I haven’t killed myself yet is because of my mom and brothers. If I didn’t have them I’d be dead long ago. But it’s getting to the point where even their love and support isn’t going to be enough to keep me alive anymore.

32,"Trapped inside a voidDear whoever cares enough to read this, though I doubt there are any that fall under that criteria.

I am trapped inside a void.  There is absolutely nothing for me.  I go through the monotonous tasks of every-day life with nothing to look forward to, no aspirations whatsoever.  The only saving grace I felt like I had, the only thing that made me feel like I was wanted, and accepted me for who I am, was Maren.  As absolutely idiotic as it sounds (and she’s assured me that it is,) talking to her was the one thing I looked forward to every day.  It was the one thing that kept me going; knowing that some time throughout the day I would be able to talk to her, even if only briefly before we went to sleep.

She made me feel accepted.  She made me feel like I had some kind of worth.  She made me feel like I could actually like myself, and be okay with who I was.  But most of all, she made me feel loved.  Never before have I ever been able to open up to someone so completely.  I felt completely at ease when talking with her.  I’ve told her things that no one else in the world knows about me, and she made me feel like she actually cared about them- that she cared about me.  We shared many intimate moments that I would never dare have with anyone else.  We talked about getting together, being with each other, devising crazy scenarios with how to be together.  We talked all the time, nothing could keep us apart.  Except for Ty.  She helped me through all of the problems I was facing related to my depression over the break-up with Starr.  She talked to me whenever I needed her, and she always made me feel better about it.  She was my shining star in a pitch-black sky.  None of this is any longer, though.

We have slowly drifted apart as she began to realise exactly how I am.  I am sure she regrets getting involved with me, and I don’t blame her.  I do nothing but hurt her these days.  None of it is intentional, but it happens nonetheless.  When we first started talking again, I told her about my clingy tendencies and she said she was okay with that.  I suppose she thought I was over-exaggerating, but I wasn’t.  I need to have interaction in my life.  I know it is not fair to the people around me, and I know that it is not what they want, but I cannot be alone in my own thoughts all the time.  My thoughts are extremely self-destructive.  I need someone to spend time with, someone to talk to to get away from my thoughts.  

For about four months I was legitimately happy.  That was probably the only time in my life I have ever actually been legitimately happy.  I was finally over Starr, thanks to the help from Maren.  I had no stress at all, things were actually looking up, even my migraines were becoming few and far between.  I was in love, and I felt loved.  If I could go back in time and re-play those four months over and over again, I would without hesitation.  That was the best time of my life.  I didn’t have people ridiculing me for various reasons beyond my control.  I didn’t have to feel like I had to hold all of my feelings inside.  I could share them with Maren, and she was incredibly receptive.  I didn’t have to lie about who I was, or leave details out.  Maren made me feel like I was a good person.  I told her about my past, and she seemed genuinely concerned for me.  She tried hard to dispel all of the hateful things I have been told about myself.  She told me that I was attractive, something I had never been told before, not even by Starr, who I was together with for ten years.  I was happy with who I was at that time.  Prior to that I had never willingly taken a picture of myself.  But with her, we would send each other snapchat pictures, and she made me feel like I wasn’t the hideous person that I thought myself to be.  In hindsight, I am sure that she was just being nice to me, and that she did not actually think I was attractive.  It was still nice to hear it, though.

I miss those days.  I long for them to return, but I know that that will never happen.  The same thing has happened with many people before, though none to that extreme.  They are fine with me when we first start talking, and eventually they realise how high-maintenance and fucked up I am.  That causes them to drift away, until eventually we stop talking altogether, or sometimes they just abruptly cut me out of their lives.  That was the case with Starr.  The night before she broke up with me she told me that she loved me.  In the morning, she told me it was over and a few weeks later told me to never talk to her again.  After ten years of being together, she ended it on a whim, and caused me to lose not only my significant other, but also my best friend.  The same thing is happening with Maren.  I am driving her away, and eventually I will not have a best friend again.  I will be completely alone.  The last time I was completely alone, right after Starr broke up with me, I didn’t leave my room for two weeks.  I didn’t eat a single thing in those two weeks.  I laid there in bed, staring at my ceiling in the darkness, constantly in tears, trying to realise where I had gone wrong.  I have never cried so much in my life.  I have hid my emotions from outside view all of my life, but at that moment I could not contain them any longer.  I had absolutely nothing left for me in the world, and that is how I feel again, right now.

It was complete luck that I was actually able to reconnect with Maren again.  I have no idea at all how to make friends.  She just happened to be online on Facebook when I was feeling at my absolute lowest.  I sent her a message with no expectations whatsoever, I was prepared to either be completely ignored, or told to go away.  That didn’t happen though.  We had a wonderful conversation, reminiscing about our childhood.  I don’t remember how the subject got changed to me talking about Starr, but I told her everything, and she seemed like she genuinely cared about it.  She stayed up with me until the morning, just talking with me on Facebook.  I was in tears for most of that conversation, partly because I was still upset about the breakup, but also because I couldn’t believe that someone actually cared.  Especially someone I hadn’t talked to in over a decade.  When we started to get close, and revealed our feelings for one another, we joked about how us reconnecting was a “red string of fate.”  I don’t believe in fate, but I also don’t think it was just dumb luck that caused us to reconnect at that moment, when I felt like I had nothing left.  The problem lies in the fact that I will never be able to replicate that with anyone else.  I am incredibly socially awkward; I cannot make new friends at all.  In person I just completely freeze up and get overwhelmed with anxiety.  Online, I just have nothing to say.  I am a boring person.  I have tried to make new friends on various subreddits, /r/r4r, /r/kikpals and the like.  I have talked to a few people who seemed nice, but none of them developed into an actual friendship.  They all stopped talking to me after one session.  I don’t have anything at all to give in a friendship.

After fighting with Maren, and being told that I can’t keep badgering her to hang out with me, when all I asked was that if she was going to be able to talk after she was done watching Game of Thrones with her new boyfriend (who was her ex,) my self-worth is absolutely rock bottom.  She has made me realise that I am the problem, that it is my fault my relationships always dissolve.  She joined me in blaming Starr for the dissolution of our relationship, but I see now that it was never her fault.  I am just completely unlovable.  I can never have more than one true friend.  I believe this stems from the fact that growing up, I had very few friends, and when I tried to expand and make new friends I got burned very badly, every time.  Because of this, I latch on to the one friend I have.  I suffocate them.  I bother them until they cannot stand it any more, and leave me.  I have tried so hard to give her space, and not ask her to hang out with me, or talk to me, but whenever I try, I get extremely depressed.  I have spent the past two weeks in extreme depression.  I was hoping that by the weekend we would be able to hang out and it would alleviate some of it, but she cancelled our plans in favour of hanging out with someone else.  Every time I ask her to do something and she says no, I get a sinking feeling.  Mainly because in the four months that I was happy, we did everything together.  Any time I asked if she wanted to do something, she was happy to hang out with me.  She was happy to talk to me nearly every moment she was awake.  I suppose that is only sustainable for so long until someone would get bored of me.  I have very little to offer, it was mainly her driving everything, and that must have been exhausting.

I am getting tired of writing, though.  I recognize my faults and all of my flaws, but I have no knowledge or motivation to fix them.  I have lived with them my entire life, and not a single person has stayed around because of them.  I am writing this because I now have zero friends.  I am completely alone.  No one in the world would even notice if I fell off the face of the Earth, or faded into oblivion.

(I amar prestar aen.)

The world is changed.

I feel it in the water.

(Han mathon ned cae.)

I feel it in the earth.

(A han noston ned gwilith.)

I smell it in the air.

Much that once was is lost, for none now live who remember it.

It began with the forging of the Great Rings. Three were given to the Elves, immortal, wisest and fairest of all beings. Seven to the Dwarf-Lords, great miners and craftsmen of the mountain halls. And nine, nine rings were gifted to the race of Men, who above all else desire power. For within these rings was bound the strength and the will to govern each race. But they were all of them deceived, for another ring was made. Deep in the land of Mordor, in the Fires of Mount Doom, the Dark Lord Sauron forged a master ring, and into this ring he poured his cruelty, his malice and his will to dominate all life.

One ring to rule them all.

One by one, the free lands of Middle-Earth fell to the power of the Ring, but there were some who resisted. A last alliance of men and elves marched against the armies of Mordor, and on the very slopes of Mount Doom, they fought for the freedom of Middle-Earth. Victory was near, but the power of the ring could not be undone. It was in this moment, when all hope had faded, that Isildur, son of the king, took up his father’s sword.

Sauron, enemy of the free peoples of Middle-Earth, was defeated. The Ring passed to Isildur, who had this one chance to destroy evil forever, but the hearts of men are easily corrupted. And the ring of power has a will of its own. It betrayed Isildur, to his death.

And some things that should not have been forgotten were lost. History became legend. Legend became myth. And for two and a half thousand years, the ring passed out of all knowledge. Until, when chance came, it ensnared another bearer.

It came to the creature Gollum, who took it deep into the tunnels of the Misty Mountains. And there it consumed him. The ring gave to Gollum unnatural long life. For five hundred years it poisoned his mind, and in the gloom of Gollum’s cave, it waited. Darkness crept back into the forests of the world. Rumor grew of a shadow in the East, whispers of a nameless fear, and the Ring of Power perceived its time had come. It abandoned Gollum, but then something happened that the Ring did not intend. It was picked up by the most unlikely creature imaginable: a hobbit, Bilbo Baggins, of the Shire.

107,"Anyone planning suicide in the long-term future?I'm a depressed 22F who is considering suicide, but not soon, but within maybe 4-5 years.
Why do I want to kill myself?
It's kind of a long story. But the main reasons are a combination: (Lack of) Economic Stability, Health Problems, Family
along with a lack of purpose or inherent value of life.

**Economic**:

Growing up was hard and I've had to overcome a lot of adversity (lower-income household, mother dying at
a young age, being a queer person of color, strict parents, depression etc), like a lot of people here.
I'm in college currently, but found that although I genuinely love learning and picked a STEM major, college 
just seems very oppressive. I know it makes me sound like an entitled, first world millenial.
My parents made me go the flagship state school directly after high school, not allowing me to choose a different school
or even CC for a few years (I had relatively good grades in high school). I knew from the moment I was on campus
that I hated it; lack of diversity and friendship, my health was negatively impacted, I didn't have a good sense of direction
or idea for a major/career and never felt inspired. I thought about transferring, but didn't have the 
resources or finances (first-generation college student), so I stuck it out though I was depressed. I did well academically
but since my major/department is kinda shitty (applied math), I'm worried that I won't get a good paying job, unlike
engineering students. Like had I known earlier, I would have just majored in that instead. I will leave college
next year with about 25-28K in loans.

**Family**:

Generally, I strongly dislike my family life. My other siblings went to medical school and basically left the house
as fast as they could. My mom died at a young age, and instead of helping me out as possible with school or becoming
self-sufficient, my dad remarried and spends his money on his new wife (unemployed) and kids, even though he's pretty old
and should be focusing on retirement. I haven't come out as queer yet, but worry that my family will disown me because of it.
(not super religous, but super conservative, strict and family-oriented). My parents are also immigrants so we don't have
tons of wealthy family here.

**Health**:
I have a lot of chronic, probably genetically-caused, health diseases since I was young.
When I was young and in my mid-teens, I was able to take care of them when my parents were employed and supportive.
After my mom died, my dad didn't bother helping me out that much and without the resources for seeing specialists
anymore, my health has decreased. It's hard at college too, because I don't have a car, and I didn't always have
health insurance to be able to see anyone. So my health continues to decrease. These aren't
life-threatening health issues, but irreverisble for the most part and make me feel insecure and self-conscious.

So because of all this, I find it hard to justify continuing life. I am kind of a nihilist and definitely 
an atheist with no absolutely no belief in the afterlife. I don't want to kill myself yet, but in 3-4 years,
when I can be more distant from my family and meticulous in suicide-planning once I'm in the ""real world"".
I've seen many psychologists over the years, but rarely find them helpful or knowledgeable, and condescending even.
It seems statistically unlikely that a queer woman of color from a first-generation college student background with severly
limited family support, chronic health issues, and student loans to be economically secure in like, even 5 years. And it's
hard to see my straight, white, male friends from more accepting and upper-middle class families succeed in life, when it's a
constant struggle for me.And even if I can push through and somehow find a way through the misery, what's the point? Why suffer and
struggle so much in life if I don't really see a reason too? Basically I created this post to see if anyone else agreed
with me and is truly planning suicide in the future.I'm also fine with talking to people about my choices and/or
expanding on the reasons above, though I doubt people can change my mind.

TL:DR: Want to wait 3-4 years before committing suicide. Basically I personally see life worth living if
I'm economically secure, have supportive family and friends, and am generally healthy. However, for a multitude of complex
reasons, all of the above factors are not really possible or likely for me. I am also a nihilist, atheist and 
don't see a point to life, other than that society has stigmatized suicide and thinks everybody born should continue living.",suicide

110,"Screenwriting Course Scripts and Characters that commit suicide (and other parts of dealing with depression)I've been a little low lately, so this matters to me. I'm long past the days where every moment feels like breathing underwater, so it only hurts a little.

I wrote the outline for my script a year and a half ago, when I was in the worst throws of my depression and was nearly hospitalized. And now, as I am in the class that comes after that basic course, I have to finish the script. I like how the script has grown and changed, and it certainly has a broader scope than the depression that haunted me. 

But today I had to write the little part where the character considers committing suicide. It was like I was seeing myself doing his actions. There is another character that is the voice of depression, and every line I wrote was the ideas that I had in my head. It was like writing down my thoughts, from the past. Too easy to write, which meant I could zoom past it faster, but I could never watch this script come to life. It would be too traumatic. I couldn't let other people  see that too. Especially people who know what its like.

I know it isn't the same, now that I'm much better, but I feel like I could see myself cutting to stop myself from committing suicide, or looking over the edge of a building, sad that I was hesitating and that I wouldn't do it. Confused if that was really what I wanted.

Another complexity. I feel like I've become the expert on suicide, hospitalization, therapy, group therapy, anti-depressants, and depression within my class. Too many scripts don't get it right. It's never as straightforward as they write it. Even now, it's not straightforward; a part of me, very small, wants to kill myself. A larger part of me wants to be off antidepressants, even if it means that I fall back into depression. An even larger part of me is ready to cut myself at a moment's notice, to just stop pain. And now I will talk about the script during class, like opening up too much of a wound. We will see how much it bothers me. I don't think it will too much, but who knows, right?

Someone in my class wasn't clear about what the character was doing (accident or attempt). To me it sounded like a suicide attempt, and if it is, well... I guess I'll have to tell her that there's no realistic way that she would get out of the hospital the same day. Even if it is an accident, someone would be asking her about her intent.

My life keeps getting more and more complex the farther I am from the epicenter of my depression. Not that I don't have depression (getting much closer to stable though).

I know this is long, and I though this isn't entirely related. But I just wanted to show this to people who know what it's like to consider suicide, or know a bit about the ambiguity, treatment, and reactions that follow it.",suicide

Okay, so I guess the best way to begin this is to just tell you straight up that I’m gay. This wouldn’t be an issue if I didn’t have strictly conservative parents, I know a lot of people have it worse off than me, but I feel like most of my problems stem from this.

I haven’t been diagnosed as anything really, but I don’t really care because it doesn’t take a fucking expert’s opinion to tell you there is something genuinely fucking wrong with me. Lately I’ve been feeling more and more suicidal, and have been planning my suicide more and more and how I could enact it with little to no effort whatsoever. And right before the time of this post in fact, I’ve cut myself for the first time. Very shallow cuts, 7 of them. Worst part of it was trying to get the bleeding to stop, even now.  That and I’ve been feeling like absolute SHIT consistently for 4 months now, so yeah there’s definitely something wrong.

To further go into detail about the cutting, looking back at it, I snapped and started cutting, going deeper than anything I’ve tried to cut and with such force and pressure. I’m glad there was only an exacto knife nearby, if anything else I think I may have bled out. What scares me about this is 1. how I snapped and started cutting myself and how fast I went to cut myself and 2. How the fuck I’m going to hide the cuts and if someone asks what excuse I could possibly come up with.

At the time of typing this, yesterday during work I was so miserable that I contemplated walking out climbing up a tree, tying my hoodie sleeves on both the tree and my next and just letting myself fall. I obviously didn’t do this, and even if I were to walk out, I’d probably wouldn’t because I felt like if I did, I’d just spread my suffering to my family. 

About my family : As I stated previously, they’re an adamant religious bunch, and they have no tolerance for gays, heresy and mental illness, so I have to act as if I were something I were not around them, and I think the facade is taking a toll on my mind because then I feel like I have no actual personality and that I just have to be fake around people to make them happy at the time. I’ll be honest, it’s hard sometimes but I feel no sense of “selfness” I have never EVER even gave them a hint that I would ever be gay, I try to make it seem like gay isn’t even a comprehensible subject and that it is something so outlandish it shouldn’t exist. However, recently I have told my mother that I am feeling anxious about everything, stressed over tiny things and that I’m feeling like absolute shit and I’ve been considering suicide and she just yells at me and tells me I’m lazy and that even I couldn’t amount to anything if I gave it all of my willpower, and what hurts more than the words is the expectation being shattered. I just want someone to understand me, and to love me for what I am, and genuinely acknowledge that there is something wrong with me, and that I need help, but it just makes me so fucking sad that it’s never going to happen, I don’t even tell this sort of stuff to my one friend because it just ruins the atmosphere and brings the mood down, so I can’t just do that. I feel like I genuinely have nobody, I feel so isolated and alone. I know there are those who have it so much worse off than me, and I try to rationalize the situation in consideration of the fact, but I can’t help but feeling so fucking bad.

I am scared that I’m going to kill myself soon, I just want things to stop being shit, I’ve been feeling like this on and off for almost 5

129,"Best resource for mental health help for somebody without a lot of money?I've been dealing with the death of my father for about a year and it comes and goes with how well I can actually deal with it.  The past few months have been especially hard for some reason.  I have very little money left, no immediate family, one friend I see once a week, and a fiancee who I love but who is also under a great deal of mental and emotional stress (and being around me doesn't make it any better).  I have talked to both master's and PhD level therapists this year and it never helps.  Talk therapy doesn't fix anything for me.  Maybe it's because my bachelor's degree is in psychology but it never helps anything.

The days where I don't think about (bad things) are probably fewer than the ones where I do, and that makes me so sad.

Sometimes I feel like I can't do it anymore, and it disappoints me because I've got a lot going for me on paper (got accepted back to college for a second bachelor's degree recently), but most days it's a struggle just to wake up and go to my job.  I feel like I just want to go away and let the world go on without me, and I realize that's a dangerous kind of thinking that I need to nip in the bud before it gets the better of me.

I was drinking a lot this past year but I've been trying to quit for a few weeks too.  Not being able to numb myself to the same degree has led to many nights where I don't sleep well, where I get lost in my own thoughts, and where I go to bad places quickly.

I have many hobbies and I have passions, but I have no passion for those passions on my bad days.

I need to do something to fix myself.  I don't want to have this constant cloud over me anymore.  Any ideas as to what I should do?

I feel like the levels between my coping mechanisms and my overwhelming pervasive depression are very skewed in the direction of the latter.

Thanks for listening anyway, helped to type that out.

**Edit:**  To clarify, I am talking about real, actual mental health help - or perhaps medication - not reading self help books, not going for a run, not meditating.  I have done all of those things ad nauseum.  I do them regularly.  I try to fill my life with as much of the ""positive lifestyle"" kind of stuff as I possibly can, but it's not working.  I've read everything from the entire Taoist canon to Marcus Aurelius to Steven Hawking to Kierkegaard to Tai Chi masters and beyond.  Respectfully, please understand that telling me to just jog it off isn't going to help.  I work out daily.  I am meticulous about trying to eat healthy.  I don't drink like a fish anymore.  I need real help and I don't know what to do.",suicide
131,"I think I need to check myself into a hospital. I need your guys' advice.4 weeks ago I got diagnosed with a major depressive disorder. It wasn't really news, I've known I've been depressed for years (approaching 3 1/2 years now). I got prescribed Zoloft, and I'm up to 75mg now. I've also been attending therapy sessions with a psychologist for about 6 weeks now. Its not working though. If anything over the last few months its just been getting worse and worse, and it feels like it's not even getting worse at a slower rate.

Over the last few years I've made a lot of changes to try to help. I went from 198 to 150, I started eating healthier, I changed majors to something that I both enjoy more and that has more career prospects, I transferred colleges since the first one wasn't working out, I joined a few clubs and have actually made a few friends, I even attended my first college party after 2 1/2 years of never being invited to anything. Now I've finally gone to get professional help, both psychologic and psychiatric.

And none of it has helped. If anything, its only gotten worse since I don't even have the hope that any more changes will help. The hope is gone. When I was a kid, I used to get Pneumonia a lot. I had it like 5 times before I was 3. I wish I'd have just died back then, I could have saved so much pain and my parents could have moved on, now I have a ton of other people to drag down with me.

The latest ""I think I would be happy if..."" thing has been getting in a relationship. I think I'm thinking this is the latest thing, since its one of the only changes I haven't yet made, and because I pretty genuinely hate myself (I've pretty much derived any self worth over the last few years from my GPA, I don't really believe in inherent self-worth). I'm almost 21 now and haven't ever been on a date, let alone received a non-platonic hug. Nobody ever expresses interest in me, I always have to initiate (thought I've found this is usually the case with my friends as well, if I don't initiate I'd never get invited to anything). I can't even watch porn anymore without feeling like shit. It's not like I can avoid all these people in relationships either by isolating myself since I still have classes to go to. It feels like all the changes I've made over the years have amounted to nothing.

I'm just so terribly lonely and miserable all the time. I haven't been able to cry in years, so I just self harm when I feel like crying. It's not the best release, and it feels like it has diminishing returns, since lately it doesn't give me the rush it used to, it just makes it a little easier to breath if that makes any sense. Besides, it beats drinking heavily like most 'normal' people my age do (though admitably I much prefer being drunk to not being drunk).

All my friends are out building up lives and resumes and careers. It feels like I've gotten left behind on the road of life. Everyone is dating, some are already married with people they love. I get PMs from one of my friends from high school asking me if I've started dating yet. I keep trying to explain to him that I'm trying but not having any luck. Whenever dating comes up, that's all I ever get ""I'm sure you'll find someone eventually."" Thing is, none of the ""I'd might be happy if..."" things before have obviously failed, but this is the only change left I can make, since professional and medical help has failed.

I don't enjoy anything anymore. Dota 2 and CSGO feel like chores, EU4 is too frustrating now. I've already played through all the RPGs I enjoy to the point of them being mechanical to play through. I don't enjoy running or hiking as much now, and its too cold to do them anyways this time of year. I don't have any shows I really enjoy. I've always wanted to learn to draw, I'm actually a huge fan of furry art, but I'm pretty bad and I'm a perfectionist, so practicing is so frustrating that I pretty much can't do it and get better.

Suicide has increasingly been looking like the only way things are going to get better. The logic I mean with ""get better"" is that zero is still larger than a negative number, so I'd be better off. I used to think ""Ok, I'll wait until I turn 30, and then I'll kill myself if things haven't improved."" However, as things have deteriorated, I've moved that up to 25. More recently, I've moved it up to after graduation (I'm thinking It could be my own graduation present to myself). I don't even know how I'm going to make it that far. Suicide feels inevitable at this point, like its something I have to do.

I don't buy the whole ""it gets better"" thing anymore. Its been over 3 years. It really doesn't in my experience. All the medical advice I've been given when the suicidal thoughts get really bad is to distract myself. I don't understand to what end though? Like, if I don't kill myself now, then what? I get to continue hurting tomorrow? The only end this seems to lead to is ""why kill yourself now when you can just keep hurting tomorrow ad infinitum?"" I don't see the appeal in it. I think once I do it, I'll go out to a nice secluded part of one of my local national parks I like and shoot myself in the head really late at night. Nobody would notice I'm gone, possibly for a few weeks, nobody would hear a thing, I might not even be found. My body can feed some scavengers, I don't have to hurt anymore, people who love me don't have to see me hurt anymore, everyone wins. I've been dead inside for years, its just taking the rest of me a while to catch up. Of course, this is still likely a few years away, so I'm probably not at immediate risk of killing myself.

So thats where I'm standing. It's 3AM right now and I can't sleep anymore because I went to bed at 7 last night because I was out of energy and feeling suicidal again. The Zoloft just gives me headaches, makes me hungry, and gives me constipation. Nothing has helped, and I don't think I can get better anymore.

I have another therapy session with my psychologist later this afternoon. I don't know what to do anymore or what more I could tell him at this point. What should I do?

That’s the oldest I’ve ever been. It’s the oldest I’m ever meant to be.


I don’t remember when I had the first dream. It probably happened when I was so young that I wouldn’t even be able to remember. They are always fragmented and real… Real in the way that when it ends, your eyes open and you’re lying in bed wondering.


“Did I just wake up… or just fall asleep.”


The fragments don’t seem to follow a timeline; just clips like a hazy recollection of a night out. Remembering moments out of a long series of events.


In these dreams, I’ve seen the events of my life, tragic and wonderful, play out before me. Sometimes months or years before they are experienced in the chronological timeline.


It took time to get used to having these dreams; especially the dark ones, the ones where a friend or family member passes and I’m forced to spectate as a silent observer in their final moments. It wasn’t until my teens that I felt like I understood what they were. As stupid as it sounds, clairvoyance runs in the family. If you believe in that type of thing. I’ve cousins who experience the same. We’ve talked about them, shared our different perspectives of events yet to come and those that we didn’t understand until the timeline unfolded in front of us.


29


Out of the thousands of dreams, every one of which that has so far played in my synapses, not one of them shows me past the age of 29. My 30th birthday is now less than 60 days away.


I’ve lived with suicidal ideation for nearly two decades now. Before I had ever met my wife, I had come to a decision. I wasn’t going to live past the age of 27, in fact I was going to end my life on my 27th birthday. I can’t say for certain why I chose 27… Partially because I was an angst filled young adult who thought if I was going to die young, I should join the group of others who died famously young at 27 (except I’m far from famous). 27 also happens to be my favorite number, I could not tell you why, I’ve always just been drawn to it.


When my 27th birthday rolled around I was a newlywed of 3 months. To say that ending my life on that day was the last thing on my mind then would be to lie to you. The plan I’d concocted still toiled about in my brain that day. But my plans had changed.


29


It began to stand out in my mind that the dreams never showed me past a certain age. The limit was always twenty-nine. There are none where I’m a proud father, watching my children go. None of me in my golden years enjoying life with my wife who’s aged so much better than I over the years. After 29, they just stop.


We fixate on negatives, humans that is. It’s an exercise in willpower and determination to train ourselves to focus on the positives in life and not dwell on the negatives. I’m far from being a master at this myself.


“Why don’t I see myself as older than 29 in any of these?”


Is it because that’s when my story ends? Will my life be destined to have a dash between 1987 -2017? Am I finally going to break in the next two months and have the gumption to take my own piece off the game board?


Or is it something more positive… Does the family’s clairvoyant trait only take us so far in life? Is it a gift we are given to be shown, in part, the events of our future that will violently shape the people we will become? Glimpses to show us that, no matter how low and dark things are going to get, you are going to make it through this?


Maybe we aren’t clairvoyant. Odds are it’s just the family disposition for schizophrenia, another wonderful future to look forward to thanks to inherited genetics. I’ve already been dealing with auditory hallucinations since childhood, though one might argue those spawned from abuse and not genetics.


Is it going to end at 29… am I going to see the other side of 30? If I don’t, is it going to be my own doing? Maybe I’m not allowed to see how my own story ends, not until I experience it first hand, so as to not spoil the moment.


I don’t make a conscious effort to avoid my suicidal ideation. I did at one point, but then I accepted that part myself. The part that feels, knows, that suicide is an option. I can’t say I go more than a week without at least the tiniest thought of it coming into my mind. That thought of throwing yourself into the void when staring into it. The thoughts just happen and like other thoughts they are sometimes discarded immediately. Others are turned and inspected; what-if situations played out over and over.


“How would she react?”


“What would the funeral look like?”


How many dominos would fall if I cast my own down? Some may topple like my own, but there would be many that would wobble for ages… Likely never settling back down into their original position.


That’s the hardest hurdle for me, in regard to bringing myself to committing to ending it myself. My empathy for those in my life, knowing or at least thinking I know how my life ending would impact theirs. More so if it was self-inflicted.


It has always been easy to hurt myself. Intentionally hurting others that I care about though, has always felt impossible. I know I’ve caused harm to them without the intention of doing so and felt immense guilt after the fact, again and again. So I’ve never been able to follow through with a plan because of the line of thinking that happens at that point of the planning.


Within the next two months am I going to finally disregard others’ feelings and selfishly satisfy my own, I’m not even sure what to call it, desire or what I believe to be my stories already written ending? Perhaps it does end, but not by any doing of myself. Just the chaos of existence.


With some luck, maybe… Just maybe 29 isn’t the end… It’s just a new beginning.

176,"I can't live with this thought, I feel sick. During last summer, I developed a sense of high anxiety around being in the company of young people/babies that I'd never had prior. This was a result of feeling intense distress over finding out that an ex teacher was a pedophile. I came to realize in March this year through research that this is called POCD, which provided me with a lot of relief.

In the late evening of Monday, 23rd September 2019 after having moved back into university halls of residence for my second year a week prior, I basically watched pornography for around about 2-4 hours intermittently when my depression was as its worst height. I'd already experienced false memories by this point.

Anyway, for that whole afternoon and night, I would go from grinding/humping against the bed (an awkward way of doing it that I developed when I was in my early teens) while watching Porn Hub on my phone, to then sitting up and watching random videos on YouTube.

The second to last video I watched was a video of Kurt Cobain and his 2 year old daughter, that appeared on the homepage after going back from Porn Hub and sitting up in bed again. At this point, I remember thinking that if I were to watch this video, I shouldn't watch another video afterwards, purely ''because this YouTube video had a baby in it'' - even though I knew deep down that the two videos were entirely separated by tabs on my phone, not to mention obviously by content. Nevertheless, I watched the interview video, scrolled through the comments and paused at a specific point then went back to Porn Hub, and only then did I kneel down to grind the duvet again, but with a video loaded.

Finally, I remember sitting up again and going back to the YouTube homepage and the first video shown was a slideshow of Cobain's daughter through the years and I remember feeling so much guilt for having watched the prior porn. The reason for this is that - as best as I can describe - seeing her (as a baby, the pinnacle of innocence) exemplified the essential humanity that we all have, including the adult performers. As a result, I felt heavy guilt (that I now realize to be misplaced) for being what I considered to be ''anti-feminist'', and an ''evil person''.

Perhaps I overthink the morality of things, I don't know.

My brain at the time immediately started to go into overload and overlap what would otherwise be two separate actions of watching YouTube then lewd stuff. I remember going to the sink afterwards, and dry-vomiting.

With regards to the actual first-person recollection of possibly staring at the Cobain video, I have no explicit sensory memory of this. The 'image' in my head is grainy at best. I wouldn't have been able to live with myself were this the opposite.

After leaving the bathroom and panicking a lot, I walked through it step-by-step, and eventually felt comfortable enough that I hadn’t done anything wrong and so I left it. This, as a general worry didn't reappear again till May 2020, with the rest of 2019 being spent going from day-to-day worries and false memories. I even felt happy and content on New Year's Day this year.

Surely, if I'd done this horrible thing, I wouldn't have been able to feel anything happy ever again?

At first, I wondered if I did do it, and I just repressed it, or I didn’t and actually it’s just my overactive imagination mixed with my anxiety. I know that in my heart I didn’t do anything wrong, as I had listened to Nirvana plenty of times afterwards, and didn’t feel pangs of guilt or shame that I know I would’ve if I’d done anything wrong.

Things have gotten better mildly. My first appointment with an OCD therapist is soon. I'm currently on the fourth day of taking a beta-blocker to regulate my heart-rate and blood pressure that helps ward off the panic attacks I have about it. I'm trying to sleep better, but sometimes the image creeps in too much. I'm due to get a new set of the anti-depressant mirtazipine soon, too.

But even with that, it all feels like too much right now and I'm more suicidal than ever about this. I don't want to die over an image in my head, but is this a belated guilty conscience? I feel sick and can't think or sleep. I have moments of 'you know you're being silly, start living again', but then it hits my head over and and I end up in bed depressed for another week.

I worry that I might, out of a morbid curiosity, have done it. I remember faintly thinking how awful it would be to do it, and then - as far as I know - not doing it.",suicide

180,"no rewards for resistensehi reddit. i am an anon. i do not know why i am postting this reaaly. perhaps a chance to hear myself speak? perhaps an open forum to categorise my thoughtS? perhaps just because... and because is enough.

ten years ago i gave up on life. i crossed a lne.

it's not despair or depression that keep me beyond that line. it is fatigue.

a member of my family was suisidal. to my knowledge they still are. we don not speak about it. we are unable to now.

i supported them for years. dropped out of school to work and finnancially keep them afloat. i cooked. cleaned. i managed our lives. while they drunk. got depressed.

they had been committed to a mental institution once for a failed attempt. i still remember the smell of that building. the glazed eyes of the patients who were being medicated there. the woman who began a conversation with me saying that she did not kill her husband and the haunting knowledge that i first heard the phrase ""never say goodbye, that is forever. only say see you later"" from her lips.

three years i supported that person. because i love them. we were all the other had in the world. i was too weak to stop them drinking. how could i take away their vice? what else would they do while i worked?

their depression grew stronger. i soldiered on.

eventually it got too much. another failed attempt. they had already taken the pills before i got home.

i always blamed myself for not dealing with them when drunk. i supported in all ways but never well enough.

we argued. i was tired. empty. had nothing left to give.

i yelled at them. i told them how i would benefit from them giving in and just doing it. they did not back down. they called my bluff. they told me to do it with them.

that pure and perfect opportunity to just exit. in that moment i was ready. i was ready because i had given everything and the atlas struggle would finally be over if i just did not fight or resist anymore. if i just let reality wash over me and consume me. ---to this day that feeling of surrender is one of the best emotions i can remember. i was ready.

they backed down when i agreed. they saw what their attitude had done and in a moment of selflessness my family member backed down.

we sat up that night. the pills were still in their system.

they did not die.

years pass.

i move on.

they move on.

that night lives on as a memory only in my head. there are times i wonder if it happened at all. how would i know if it had or had not.

time kept pushing on me. struggle after struggle came and i conquered them.

while caring for my family member i had developed an ability to weather these storms. push through. get through. keep your head down. survive. endure.

god it's such a struggle.

that memory of surrender haunts me.

but i have family now. i have friends. i have people who need me.

so i weather.

i endure.

i found the best way to cope with life is to disassociate with it. not take it on board.

i no longer know how to handle compliments.

my years of training under a suicidal dependant have made me terrified of failure. if i do not live to every expectation i will make things worse. i will cause an episode. i need to do everything. for everyone.

i make life a struggle. i keep heaping on these challenges. taking on more responsibility. breaking myself.

and i never feel satisfaction.

that's the worst part. i don't even feel relief anymore. once i've accomplished something. i just press on.

that has become my life. add on more. feel more pressure. never release. never pride. only failure.

i'm so tired.

and i don't know how to ask for help. i cannot expect anyone to understand. i try so hard to explain it but the words do not come out right.

""you should feel pride""

""take some credit""

and if i speak up they take the rug away... ""you should not do so much"" ""you know what happens when you push yourself""

i feel worthless when that happens.

so i just disassociate. stop thinking of myself. stop applying my self to anything. that way i no one will bother me. no one will make me feel worse by trying to rescue me.

i do not feel sad. i do not really feel happy. i just go with the flow. think about how others feel all the time. live to make them happy. at least then my presence will be worthwhile.

i fake it.

i fake it because i can not remember how to be honest.

when people try to get in i kneejerk push them away. i keep trying to push past that. all i can do is offer content without emotion. i cannot apply myself to any story. to any pleas. i just sit here rotting in the back of my brain.

where no one will be dragged in to my void.

where no one will watch me dead on the inside.

where no one will offer pity.

no shame.

no being locked in like i once was.",suicide

182,"I just feel like there is no point delaying the inevitableI've graduated from one of the best universities in my country which I'd got accepted with a scholarship and national degree in university entrence exams. I've graduated with 3.2/4 gpa score. I've gone to Sweden with Erasmus programme, I've played in a great band for the first 3 years of my university life, had been selpt with 5-6 women which I had a serious relationship that last 2.5 years with 2 of them. I've graduated and got accepted for the graduate school that I wanted and currently I am studying Game Technologies. My first ever game had got downloaded by 2 million people during my first job experience. This year at 14th Februrary, everything was changed. My girlfriend dumbed me for a fuckboy, my parents got divorced (and they were very verbal to me about this topic), I had to swtich jobs because I thought I was underpayed and being used there and now I am working in defense industries (totally different industry that I'd imagine for my career). I dont know, I think I've accomplished much during my school years but whenever I look back I say to myself I could do better. 

I could do better if I was living in a different country, I could do better if I didn't waste my time on two long serious relationships. I could do better if I decided to study abroad and just accept my parent's offer to pay for it (I didn't want to make them pay for MY education). I could do better if I didn't have a girlfriend when I was living in sweden with eramus programme. I could do better if I didn't stop making music or writing poems and stories, I could do better if I didn't take the job at defense industries so early that quitting the job means getting banned from the best paying sector in Turkey. Everything I did seems like a failure to me. And worst of all, I've gained a lot of weight, my self esteem is on the ground, I just stopped believing myself or in other words I stopped lying myself about I can accomplish anything.

Anyways, for people around me, I am a succesfull, mature, intellectual, functioning person with interesting hobbies. But inside of my mind, these things just doesn't matter. I was so pumped by my parents, my friends and my girlfriends, nothing I do satisfies me and I am feeling like I am slowly losing all my skills (social, artistic, general etc.). 

I dont add value to anyone around me. Noone needs me, Noone craves for my love, needs my support, needs me around them. 

I was such a nice guy to all my friends and lovers. But in the end I was the one who got screwed up by them. I can not seem to get laid nowadays, if you exclude some of my ex gf's. that really affects me because I was used to have a regular sex life (and boy, it was great). I cannot meet with new people and make them like me like used to. I could sit on a table that I know only one person at that table and carry the conversation for hours but now I am just struggling with even answering the basic questions. I used to have strong believes about life, politics, relationships (I'm an atheist), and know I realize that these believes just made me loser in the end and I cannot change them because they are infused into my mind. 

Turkey is a very depressing place if you have at least slightly above the average intellectual capacities, and I feel like I am trapped in this place where people are sooo terrible; muslim-heads who long for the glorious days of ignorance and bigotry of ottoman empire, wannabe ""highly cultural"" social media slaves/plaza workers, bigheaded academics who doesn't give a shit about their thesis student, women who satisfies themselves with shallow relationships or expects irrationally much from men, people who cannot appreciate a good company and keep expecting a personal benefit from every relationship they have. 

Fuck I am so overwhelmed trying to describe the state of mind I am in, I am so sorry people. I wish English was my mother tongue, but it isn't and I am not confident the way I express myself. 

This life, is too complicating, too demanding, too shallow and most importantly too worthless especially in Turkey. I want to leave here, but I don't know if I can find the happiness and peace in another country. Here, I am an intellectual, succesfull computer engineer; outside of Turkey, I am a fucking roach. I've sent my cv to a lot of places outside the country. Noone wants me. How do I escape here? Should I escape here and leave all of my successes and failures behind me and start a new life? Would it worth the effort? I don't know.

Death, seems like such a sweet release to me. I just want to die, naturally, at this moment, in an instant. I had enough. I had my peak  at this life and I am just slowly going down to a horrible end I can feel it. I've been depressed before, even got some medical treatment for it. It doesn't feel like being depressed at all. It is just... there is no meaning in anything at all. We are bunch of atoms. Dying will just stop all of it. I wouldn't care for anyone and anything If I was dead. I wouldn't be upset about the fact that I could do much, have children and stuff. Dead doesn't care. Dead is dead and for the last month I just feel like there is no point delaying the inevitable. ",suicide

He was hungup on an ex girlfriend and when he talked about her it would hurt me each time, I felt like I would never be good enough compared to her. Why was she good enough for him to date but not me? It messed me up so much. He would say things like ""I would be the luckiest guy if you were my girlfriend"" or 'you would be the perfect girlfriend"". At the same time he would brush off discussions I've tried to have about relationships and would say ""you deserve a nice boyfriend"" and things like that.

218,"here's my debate for why violent video games reduce violence IRL I'm having a debate competition and the motion is this house believes that violent video games lead to violent acts in young audiences, so o figured this would be of some help against the banvideogames subreddit, (it's not too good rn)

most of the time we commit violent acts because we're angry or frustrated, by commiting violent acts in the game we vent these emotions out in the game instead of in the real world, say for example DOOM(you know the drill we all like BFG division). you might say that video games can culture some really toxic people, but speaking into a mic and speaking to a face are two different things, I have friends that literally gang up on me and ban me from their Minecraft server because they were in a bad mood, the next day I had a few words to say to them and they just stood there and let me run my mouth (I just didn't feel like letting them have their way so I did a thing), that's why I think cyberbullying isn't a problem, if you know how to treat is properly(my own opinion, you guys might know something I don't)

Anyway...

He's so amazing. I love him so much, our 4 year anniversary is coming up on February 14. I got him his gift and it's currently in transit. I just wanted to say he's literally the most amazing thing to ever happen to me, I wouldn't be the person I am today without him. I... live in an extremely toxic home, and I hate it, I'm not allowed to date but I don't care, I fell in love with someone, and we've been together almost 4 years now. He's so amazing...He's so kind, and charming, and passionate, and loving, and willing, and handsome and cute and literally any positive thing you can think of. He has no flaws. He's so perfect in my eyes. He's been there for me when literally no-one else has.  I couldn't be more thankful. I am so lucky, that everyday I get to call this wonderful human mine, and I get to call him cute everyday. Things have been hard with covid, we've been apart 315 days, which is, to most LDR's silly, but he's my only friend. I...am a pretty lonely person, but that's alright. I have about 2 other close friends and that's all I really need. He's literally my best friend. He's been with me through everything. Like I said, I have a toxic home-life, my father is a POS and my mother...she isn't much better. Before him, I knew there was something mentally wrong with me, and to this day my parents still don't really believe I have an anxiety disorder and I quite possibly could be depressed. (not being dramatic it's rough.) He is also my first, well everything just about. This is the first real-real relationship I've been in, he was my first kiss, my first slow-dance, my first everything. He's so timid and gentle and knows exactly how I'm feeling even if I don't tell him initially. He tells me he's proud of me, and the first time he told me that, I broke down into tears. No one has ever ever told me they were proud of me, he sees the smallest steps I take and he recognizing me for them. I've been working my hardest on not apologizing so often and getting a grasp on my anxiety. I know to some now, it's so silly to think that you're first relationship is the one you're gonna marry. But I so truly believe he'll be the one I marry, I want to get married to him, I want to have a life with him. These past 4 years, I haven't felt sad, like ""unneeded"" sad, of course I have days, but he's literally lit my life up. I wrote a poem about/for him last year and in the poem, I talk about how he re-lit my ""spark"". My spark is well myself, my personality, my happiness, my passions my all of it. I don't think I could ever begin to repay him. With everything he's done...I'm overjoyed. And I tell him all of this everyday and he takes it with such modesty, or ""I know I'm all these things, but so are you"" He knows me, he knows who I am, he's the first person to ever willfully get to know who I am, and to love every, single, inch of me, even the parts I can't love right now.

&amp;#x200B;

I think I'll stop there for now, I could novels upon novels about my love for him, but I think now is a good time to stop.

238,"I want to end my lifeI just need to vent I have no one I can tell this to.

I moved back home to my grandmas after a stressful two years of college and a failed relationship due to drug addiction on both parties. We were both insanely depressed, I thought I did the good thing moving back home but everyday still feels worse. I miss him so much it hurts. He just overdosed again two weeks ago and I heard he’s doing better but I’ve decided to go no contact, but I miss him so bad maybe I’ll do minimal contact once he’s feeling better.. I’ve had suicidal thoughts in the past, but it’s gone out of control since moving back home. My life has no direction or meaning. All I do is bother everyone. My mind is so hazy that I cannot focus. Getting out of bed is insanely difficult. Going out in public feels like everyone is either scurrying away from me or staring at me, I know it’s my head playing with me man. I feel like a monster and it feels like everyone can see it. It’s hard making friends and I don’t want to bother my friends down here.

I had a decent job paying me 15 an hour but it was insanely stressful, when I moved back home I applied to jobs near me and quickly got one as a front desk agent at a nice hotel paying me 10 dollars an hour. It’s definitely slower paced and cool but the down time is absolutely killing me. My thoughts eat my alive.

I hooked up with an ex two nights ago because I craved being touched but obviously I feel 10x worse. The sex was meaningless he was just ramming my cervix the whole time but I didn’t want to ruin the moment or make him mad by saying it hurt so I just waited for it to end. We smoked after and chatted for a bit. Played some video games and cuddled and fell asleep, well he did but I just stared at the wall for hours. It felt so good to be high again. Yesterday morning at work I was really irritated because my cervix feels insanely sore, I got no sleep, and my emotions are completely out of control. I’m usually sweet but I felt like a ticking time bomb all day.

Housekeepers told me to call my boss so they could print their reports because no managers were there. I told them to call them because I was busy, but they stood behind me for 10 minutes while I took phone calls and did my paperwork because they’re english is bad and they wanted me to do it... they were communicating with me just fine. So I snapped and said “what do you want me to do?! Did y’all call them like i told you?” they said they called the gm and my boss but they didn’t answer their phones and they left a voicemail. So I dialed the sales manager because i knew she was awake because she called me earlier, and she gave me an attitude on the phone and she dates my boss, so he got on the phone and yelled at me not to call her. I said I only called her because him and the other boss didn’t answer their phones, and to never speak to me in that tone again and maybe they shouldn’t tell us to call them whenever they aren’t there if we need help if they don’t want to help. So what’s the point in their numbers posted on the bulletin board, I ripped it off and told the housekeepers that I can’t help them and to please go away.

I had so much downtime of just standing there and reading news articles that I opened word and typed how I was feeling. It wasn’t meant to be a suicide note, but I did mention how I wanted to do it. Which is unimportant but if anyone is interested, I want to drive far away listening to music until I’m tired, then I want to drive into a body of water and drown. I don’t know when I’ll do it but I fantasize about it every day I drive home from work. I’m too coward to shoot myself or hang myself. I don’t want my family to find me. If my body is found I want my ashes to be spread in fields of flowers and trees. I thought I closed the word document, but I have ADHD and would lose my head if it wasn’t attached to my body. So I had anxiety all yesterday that I left the document open and my boss who yelled at me called me at 11:55 last night and I’m wondering if that is why. Why else call me at that hour. Maybe I’m overthinking.

So now I’m thinking should I not show up to work? Maybe have a me day? I don’t even know how to have a self care and love day. I’m just too scared to go to work :( I don’t know if anyone would even care to read this. I feel so lost and lonely. If anyone wants to talk, I’d be so happy to...",suicide

let me start by a brief intro

im 14 and live in canada. i have shitty fucking parents and i have no life

my life is a repetition of study 24/7 then piano 24/7 and secretly game 24/7 (yes im asian, korean to be exact), swim 24/7 and read boring ass classic books 24/7

so my teenage years are looking like theyre gonna get fucked and i dont think i can handle me getting old as well

so i thought of this brilliant idea that if i dont want to get old, ill just kill myself

before all this, i always thought that death was interesting. i read a lot of articles about death and read philosophical korean manga about death.

im curious to what happens to 'me' after death.

i dont think this curiosity and this low key depression will go away

267,"Just When I Think I'm In The Clear...I was so sure I was over this.  But, goodness, this new bout I slammed into is, by far, the worst I've felt in a long time.  I understand we're all trapped in our own heads, but I've never felt so tethered down like I have by this awful, sickly feeling that has been plaguing my thinking nonstop the past five days.  I know, I know, nobody should get so upset as to contemplate suicide over a girl or guy not taking an interest in them - but dang, I'm not one to feel so strongly about a potential relationship often.  At all.  So when I do, and I know I'm not doing well, it feels like I'm missing an incredibly important game changer for my life.  Yet, here I am again.  Plastering this girl with my anxieties as I try to approach her about anything.  And this one going wrong is just another lump.  Another screw up in a long line of nothing but screw ups for me.  Another nail in the coffin, as it were.

And it's not fair to her or anyone else who is subjected to my behavior.  I feel like I was just settling into great work relationships with these people at my new job, and then I go out and get drunk with them a few times and tell them all about this girl and my anxieties.  And yesterday at work when I tried to joke and talk to the girl...holy crap, I'm an idiot.  And a creep.  Then there is this other girl I really respect who is roughly the same age my sister would be had she not died years ago, and, during one of our drunken conversations, she told me how I was like ""a little brother"" to her.  Of course, this makes my heart swell with pure joy, but then I wonder how creepy does that make me?  I'm just a weirdo who pushes away people who genuinely try to care about me by getting too clingy.  The past two nights, I'd go out drinking and just tell myself (aloud unfortunately) how it would be best for me to just get this whole load of crap over with.  It upsets my friends who were drinking with me.  They genuinely do care, but I can tell this attitude I have is weighing on them lately too.  Who can blame them?  It's terrible.  And the more I think about it, the worse I get.  And the worse I get, the more I think about it.  My descent into pure, unadulterated, 100% self hatred is nearly complete.  All of this boils down to one question - ""Am I ever gonna be good enough?""  It just doesn't seem like the case.  Anytime I get a good opportunity thrown my way, I don't know how to handle it.  I've failed to adapt to society and the world.

Some people are still crazy enough to care about me for some reason though - probably mostly thanks to biology, but I've been slowly pushing away my family in addition to my friends and coworkers.  This is nobody's fault but mine, I know that.  I just don't want to hurt anyone.  I'd rather not put my parents through losing another child.  But, once I've got a safe enough distance between my family and me, I may genuinely consider checking out.  It's definitely become a legitimate, daily consideration again.",suicide

Just a disclaimer, I am African American. I’m sharing an observation and this isn’t an invitation for a racist discussion.

2020 was a wild year when it came to racial injustice. All of these protests and demands for change made me very happy and proud.

Obviously, companies see these protests and come out in support and that’s fine. But some shows and commercials seems like pandering rather than a genuine desire to increase diversity.

I was watching a paper tower commercial and it was a black animated family. I see a lot of new shows adding a number of black people to their cast. I see Harvard pledging to admit more black students. And many other commercials that you wouldn’t usually see a black face on.

This is all great until you realize that a lot of these companies only do this amid a protest that pertains to race. I’ve never seen this rush for diversity when instances are “normal” (normal meaning not a huge public outcry for racial reform).

Maybe I’m reading too far into it but it’s just what I noticed on television. Companies putting a black face as the star of their commercial and calling it progress.

281,"Does anyone else feel like they were neglected by their parents just because you were never a problem child? I know this isn't really a thing to complain about, but i've always wondered if anyone else felt the same

I wa thirdborn in my family and homeschooled for the first 10 years. My mother had to school my rwo older brothers before I came into the world and this whittled down my mothers patience. By the time I was needing to be schooled, my mother was already busy enough with my other brothers that she didn't have the capacity to give me very much attention.

By the time I was able to read well on my own, my mother would just plop a textbook down in front of me and I would go ahead and study on my own. I learned rather quickly that my mother had little patience when I asked for help twice in a row, or took too long to figure out easy stuff. Yelling and occasionally beatings would follow so I stopped asking for help altogether.

From that point on, almost everything I did was on my own. I would start to fear help itself so I would kick my rear into overdrive and focus the hell out of my times tables or whatever it was that I was studying just to avoid help altogether.

It wasn't just with studying. I was for some strange reason really sensetive to yelling and I would prefer a beating rather than a scold on pretty much every occasion. Because of this, I learned cery quickly how to be a good boy in the house, not making any trouble whatsoever. Never causing problems and never having any that I had to ask assistance with.

I had fun by myself in those times. Jigsaw puzzles and puzzle books and jacks and whatever other 1 player games I could find, I played them. Keeping all the possible problems I could cause to a minimum.

A decade down the line, i'm now older and in high school. I do exceedingly well in every class and never cause a problem for anybody. I do find myself without a social life which I considered to be a waste of energy at the time. I've also noticed that all my exceptional achievements are going pretty much unseen by my parents. I believe that they just got used to how I was never a problen and now its standard in their eyes. I grew up always being great and pushing into greatness even further is exceedingly difficult.

Now i'm 19 and I feel in sort of trapped in this image I created for my parents that I ""must always be perfect"" and ""never cause a problem"". I've worked so hard to keep this image but I feel like its tearing me down.

I feel really down all the time now. I just feel so unmotivated and unhappy. The ""good boy"" in me says to ignore all that emotional bs and just keep moving along, but its harder and harder to do that every passing day. I just feel depressed. I hide it all from my parents because this would be an issue that I would be putting onto them. ""Sorry mom, but your 3rd child has a problem"". Also, I don't even know if theyll care.

And looking back on this whole situation, I feel like I have only myself to blame. I feel like I was the one who caused my parents to not care about me because I never wanted them to care about me and I avoided it whereever I could.

I'm the one who caused them to look at me the way they do.

Combine this fact along with the fact that I thought 80% of the population already had it, and that it was very rare to give it when you do not have symptoms. I was wrong. Only 60% of the US population has it (40% is far to high for me to just not care), and you can fairly regularly give it when you have no symptoms. So, now, if I ever want to kiss a girl again, I have to warn her that I've had cold sores, and I also need to avoid oral sex because I might give my partner it down there even without any open sores.

So, this news is too much for me. I'm already miserable at my job (I've been looking for new work for three months now--my city's economy is horrible). My friend groups are breaking down (mainly people moving away or getting into relationships and forgetting about their single friends). I am not close with my family. And now, I can't even date because I'm a disgusting man who might give you cold sores.

No, I am not the ""typical"" person who you find on this subreddit. I have numerous hobbies, I stay in shape, I (I guess now formerly) was successful with women, and I had quite a few friends. But I'm lonely. I've lost my three closest friends in a span of six months (one moved, one hates me now, and the other decides that his gf is all that matters in life), and they really were like family to me--especially important since I'm not close with my own. Professionally, I'm going no where and will probably be laid off in May, and, based on my city's job market, I won't be able to find work. Therefore, I am about to become an unemployed and lonely man who is undatable.

It's the calmness--that's how I know that I'm close. The despair makes you unable to do anything, but the calmness let's you have the energy to end it. Thanks for reading, I appreciate you taking the time. ",suicide
284,"can't shake the suicidal ideationi've struggled on and off with depression for my whole adolescence, and have managed to cope the last 6 years without medication and the last 3 without therapy. it's been important to me to give off the air of being well-adjusted. i'm a good student at a good university, with good friends and good hobbies.

still, i've never been able to completely move on from thinking about suicide: in the best of times, it's distant and amusing-to-think-about, in the worst it's a seriously-considered recourse. i just can't seem to feel fulfilled by any of my relationships, any of my accomplishments. even though i imagine by most accounts i'd be considered a happy, sociable, well-liked person, i feel like i just want to tie up my responsibilities, distribute my things, and get lost. almost unconsciously, i imagine the feeling of the barrel of a gun on the roof of my mouth, or what it would feel like to jump off a bridge or jump into traffic.

Last night I made a decision to significantly harm myself with the intention to end my life.

Once I managed to recoup my thoughts I gathers my things (including my phone) and went to my parents.

In the meantime, Crisis has contacted the Police and they tracked me to my parents house. This led to an encounter where I had to discuss everything in an open dialogue and I was strongly advised to stay at my parents etc.

This isn’t the first time she referenced this before. My mother has seen me look depressed and thought it would be best to tell me that if I commit suicide, I will burn it Hell.

I am constantly of the mind set to judge if life is worth it or not, wondering how much more of existing can I stand before I just put a bullet in my head. I feel like the mindset I hold is undeserved and pathetic. Some people undergo such profound suffering for these thoughts to manifest and it's almost no wonder they do. But I have not suffered any great tragedy my life is easy, so easy compared to most people's it's pathetic. I wake up do household chores for an hour or so and play video games with my friends all day. The only great stress I have is how I will manage to grow up. Because it seems I have the lifestyle of a child when I am at my transition into adulthood. But this is also paired with the realization that the life of the average joe that lives in a part of the world with the highest life quality is doomed to the majority of their life being tedium and suffering. And that is not me just speculating I have had jobs in retail and a fast food restaurant. So I have experienced working in lowly entry level jobs and going to school and both suck the majority of the time. So I am stuck left wondering what the fuck do I do that isn't awful? I fear my life is going to turn into a game where I pick jobs hoping one of them will be good only to realize they have all sucked and then uh oh I'm real old and the majority of things I have done in life I have regretted well fuck me I guess I'll die.

I want to live for what I like all the time but I'm afraid that's too greedy, too much to ask for, the majority of people don't how could I go beyond to that state of blissful existence? Does it even exist? Am I chasing after something that can never be attained? And if that's the case how do I endure the suffering?

377,"How do I give support for someone I'm growing to despise?Little background: Few years ago my parents got a divorce and my mom began a (somewhat abusive) relationship with someone. Last year my dad died.

Shortly before my dad's funeral it became evident to my mom that she was being cheated on and the dude was going to leave her. So at our dad's funeral my mom was crying, not because her ex-husband had died but, because her boyfriend had left her (I know that my parents marriage had ended and she didn't need to feel bad about it, but to me it was extremelly disrespectful to me and my siblings --- at the moment nobody knew why she was so sad). Few days later, we were stil mourning our dad's death and the reason for her sadness showed up...

Now because her boyfriend have left her she is treatning to kill herself. Jesus Christ, My 50 years old mother is treatning to kill herself because her 36 years old boyfriend have left her!

She became insuferable, her facebook is filled with disgusting messages, posts and whatnot about how everyone is garbage and life have no meaning; she have turned away any attempt of help from any relative. She treats her 73 yo mother like shit (I believe that in her head my grandma have something to do with her being dump). She spent her new years eve on a psych clinic but isn't taking any medicine because of no apparent reason and I think that she is straight up lying to her doctors.

She is just making the lives of everyone miserable (and for me, because of the most retarded reason possible) and I don't know how to deal with it... before I try to help and just making everything worse: how do I give support if I can't stand her reasons and am in fact disgusted by it and by her actions? What should I do?

I am aware that I am the asshole in the situation for not respecting her reasons and being in general pissed at my own mother; don't need to bring that up. Or bring it, I don't know.

I don't do things that are generally bad like skipping classes or failing my classes. I study a lot and get high grades but when I do one small thing she doesn't like she shouts at me and she takes away things of mine.

I usually walk home in my area to save money and she got mad at me for it. I really wanted to save up to go to a workshop because I dont want her to take overtime or work a part time job to get me that thing I can honestly save up for. When she knew about it she got mad at me and will take away half of my allowance that I need for other things.

It honestly feels horrible at this point because it keeps happening over and over. She doesn't care about what I say about it at all. She just gets mad at me.

They also stopped letting me talk to or see my nieces 6 months ago. I was manic and delusional and put in the hospital for three weeks before they stopped talking to me. I was stable after a few days but that's how it works (especially when you have good insurance). My brothers took my dog to the pound while I was in the hospital, that devastated me and I was pissed at them when I got discharged. My family said they would stop talking to me if I didn't go to ""psych rehab"" (I haven't ever done illegal substances either than weed) but I wasn't about to be locked up again after having been locked up for three weeks.

393,"I think I'm done.I see no point in continuing my life. It has been so long since I became disillusioned with this world; the pointless cycle of work and pain to enjoy such small things for such a small time, the uncaring populace that hurts and abuses itself, the vast majority that feel no empathy. I see all of these reflected in myself too, another idiotic follower of the human condition, driven purely by emotion and not by logic. Why anyone would want to live in such a torturous existence is beyond my understanding.

I was born too early to escape it, too. Perhaps a few hundred years in the future space travel may have advanced to a level whereby some reasonable scale of exploration is possible, and I could just leave this hellhole behind, and things may have been different. But as it stands I will be long dead under any circumstances, unable to see the one thing I have dreamed of.

Only music and video games have stood between me and this. They allowed me to hide my dissatisfaction with the world inside myself and ignore it, so I didn't have to deal with it. But they haven't worked now for a good few months. The one time I found something besides those that I thought may have been worth living for was brutally wrenched from me.

This is not a decision I have made without considerable thought. The last couple of months have shown to me just how much I hate this world. Knowing that so many other people feel the same has solidified this.

Nothing I have tried has helped. No antidepressants, no therapy, no thought mechanism has eased the pain. The one person I had trust in and who could help me ran away into the arms of another man, and now I am at wit's end. Nothing stands between me and the hell and that I always tried to avoid, so what's the point in even trying to live with it.

I don’t feel like I need to give an explanation, I’d rather my issues die with me rather than existing in other people’s heads. I wrote the letter to the only friend who I’ve fully opened up to, and I was prepared to do it. Instead, I went to sleep.

For the last five years I’ve been slowly growing more and more sad and upset with life due to my own stupid mistakes.

I have a loving family and sure we don’t always get along but I love them all to pieces.

The stupid mistakes I made haunt me to this day, no one knows about them besides me and the people involved, and that kills me. I have so many passions I want to pursue, like my singing or my art however I’m terrified that if my face gets out there one day I’ll wake up to hear everyone I love knows what I did.

I was so so fucking stupid and if I could go back I would have stopped myself. It was only five years ago I found out what I did shouldn’t have happened, that I should have never done it and since then it’s been creeping up on me and eating away at me.

I can’t tell anyone about it who I care about and if I went to see a doctor and looked for help, I’d be scared someone would find out, I’m scared I’d break down, I’m scared I’d lose my place in college.

I’ve thought about killing myself so many times, I even tired not taking my crohns and colitis medication for a while, hoping this illness would kill me slowly, but kill me none the less, but my mother soon found the full pill boxes and injections.

After I dropped out I realized I was trans. Now every day someone says something to me about how I'm a pervert or a freak. People online are so vile. My anxiety has been ruthless since I was a child. I can't hold a job because I get too scared to go in after the 3rd day. I'm 25 years old, don't have a job, can't keep one. I'm fat. I'm bald. I'm trans. I don't have any worth because I can't labor and so I'm just a parasite on my dad and mom. Every job I attempt (dozens) ive failed at. Its so much. When i do work i come home crying, and in the mornings before i go in i get so scared I throw up. But you need money to live and I dont wanna keep being a burden and pathetic

I don't know what to do. I've tried dozens of medications. Multiple therapists. I was on disability for a while for the cancer, but it ended now. I'm too anxious to leave the house. I'm too anxious to make phone calls or work or do anything. What options do I even have left besides killing myself?

I've tried university but it's so lonely. I'm supposed to be in my 4th year but I barely have enough credits for a single year. I was in the gifted program so all of my high school friends are out there achieving great things and I'm just here binging and purging. Since I've turned 18, I've spent aprox. 10 months, mostly of a form(involuntary), in a psych ward. I've tried ECT twice and I'm only 20. I'm scared that it gave me brain damage because my memory is still fucked. I've tried about 20 different medications.

Well, I see a social worker, psychiatrist, and a therapist weekly. I'm on disability. Would it really be that much of a surprise to my loved ones? It'd be selfish of them to want me to continue to live this way. I'm diagnosed with Bipolar II, BPD and Bulimia Nervosa. I am just a failure and a burden. There is nothing to look forward to except misery. My friends leave me. My mother just complains about how much money I cost her. Everyone is going to die and I have such trust/abandonment issues that I cannot trust my bf not to cheat on me.

I can't tell my psychiatrist that I got the pharmacy to refill that bottle of pills security wrestled from me because he will just put me back on a psych ward. I just want to die. There is no hope at all. I don't want to wait until I'm 30 and just be in a worse position. There's no god because a god wouldn't let someone live in such agony. What have I done to deserve this? I try to go to school and smile but it just feels like I am attempting to evade my destiny.

444,"My life is falling apartHi all,

This is my first and maybe last post on here. I’ve had a pretty easy life. I went to good schools. I have wealthy parents who always loved and supported me and pushed me to do the best in life. I have a girlfriend of 2 years who I love so much. I worked in Canary Wharf ( UK Version of Wall Street ) as a foreign exchange broker for over a year and I was pretty good at it. I left that job a few days after I turned 21 to start my own brokerage. I have a group of friends who are always there for each other, my friends are my second family. We always have each other’s backs. My life should be perfect ya know. Middle class white boy with his entire life in front of him. Then it changed.

A few months ago I was involved in a car accident with a cyclist. I was driving home from my girlfriends on Mother’s Day and just didn’t see them. I missed the first one somehow but hit the front cyclist. They died a week later in hospital. In a few weeks, after the police have concluded their investigation I am going to charged with Death by Dangerous Driving. It carries a minimum of 2 years in prison and a lengthy driving ban. Due to coronavirus the firm helping me setup my own brokerage has folded, I lost all the money  I had already invested into my firm from website design and the such, which was pretty much everything I had. My girlfriend is leaving me due to the fact I’m going to prison for 2+ years. She’s also leaving me for a guy she works with, turns out they’ve been having an affair since early December... and he sexually assaulted her. Apparently I’m just that bad of a boyfriend she wants to leave me for someone who sexually assaulted her. Most of my friends no longer talk to me due to the accident and the stress of the entire situation is putting a huge strain on my dads already very weak heart. My mum cries most morning and nights over it.

I’ve always felt like I was a burden on people my entire life. I feel like I’ve let people down my entire life. I wish I could be someone different. My brother for example. He is a national swimmer, he has a masters degree in motorsport engineering and is currently an assistant lecturer. He has a house he rents with his friend in Coventry. My parents were always so proud of him. Although I said earlier that my parents loved me and supported me they have never been proud of me. They found out I smoked in year 9, I was never part of a sports team in school, I wasn’t popular. They felt I wasted my potential playing video games and going out with the few friends I had.

So basically I’ve decided to end it. My entire life I’ve let people down, disappointed people and now everything is falling apart around me. I’ve lost my friends, my girlfriend, my company and soon I’m going to lose my freedom. I had everything and now I have nothing. I used to be sure of everything and where I wanted to go in life, I wanted to bring my friends and family and girlfriend along with me.

Now it’s just me. Alone in the dark, lying in bed at 1:42am on a Tuesday morning. I’m not sure when I’ll go through with it, maybe a few days, maybe a few weeks or maybe when I’m in prison.

So long reddit.",suicide

I hate working. I hate waking up every morning, having to leave the house, and do literally anything. It's one thing when its going to classes, I enjoy that, learning/etc. But my experiment? It has me literally wanting to fucking off myself because I'm so god damn tired of doing it. I'm tired of coming in on holidays, I'm tired of dealing with my emotional problems and mental crap (I'm autistic, ocd and have severe ADHD).

466,"I'm heading back into that direction...Sorry about the length.

A little back story. I spent 3 years working as a nursing assistant where I worked nights, drove my GPA into the ground and spent most of my time binge drinking. One day I tried to drink myself to death by drinking three bottles of vodka. I don't remember much about that night. I blindly texted a few friends but I was told it was incomprehensible. I woke up to a trashed apartment. I gave my landlord my 30 day notice, submitted a request to be switched to evening shifts at my job, told my psychatrist what I did who promptly increased the dosage of a mood stabilzer he was giving me (for a mild case of type two bipolar he had diagnosed me with) and recommended a cognative therapist who specializes in alcohol abuse. I started seeing him reguarly and I thought I was doing good. I started hitting the gym and I ate healthier.

I made a miscalculation though. I thought that switching to evening shifts would make me less moody. Instead I was overwhelmed by the number of coworkers, supervisors, and politics I had to deal with. I got into nasty fights with my long distance girlfriend who had stuck with me through all this. We broke up twice in a three month period due to my insecurities and lack of trust. I'm afraid to tell her anything now because I'm afraid I'll lose the support I had when I was binge drinking.

I'm in the same rut I was before, I feel desperately alone and depressed. The therapy has made sense and has helped a little but its only been able to go so far in two months. Its hard to not beat yourself up when you've lived alone, isolated from about a dozen people for three years.

 I feel like all my hard work has been futile now. I stopped going to the gym, I only recently stopped heavily smoking pot to escape. (The constant introspection began to drive me mad.). I feel like nothing has changed. I'm still miserable and I'm still afraid to go back to school even though I want to become a therapist or a social worker. I haven't felt this terrible since I trashed my apartment. I'm worried if it gets worse I may take up drinking heavily again and try to drink myself to death.

tl;dr Was in a rut, tried to kill myself. Got help, and now I'm crawling back into my hole.",suicide

My family knows I'm really depressed and they wish they could help me. My mother tried so hard to make me feel a little better, it just doesn't work out at all.

I have too many repressed memories. I'm sick and basically stuck in bed, can't go out and do things, yet alone go to school or have a job. I'm alone. Well, I'm not ""alone"", I have many people around me, I'm lonely. I was dating a guy who was just like me. He left me, so I would get better. He thought he was dragging me down more. He was the only one who made me feel better. I miss him a lot. It's been 6 months and I still feel just the same way about him. I'm tired of people telling me ""you will get over it"" and telling me I will find someone better. I won't. I have never felt attracted to anyone ever before in my whole life, except for him. And he didn't leave me because he didn't love me anymore or for any other usual breakup reason. I can't forget about him.

It's not the breakup, it's the loneliness combined with all of my problems. Things just keep getting worse for me day by day and I just feel lonely. I wish I still had him, it was all I needed. I just can't get through this alone. I can't. It's too much.

495,"Back here again...I don't know if this happened on its own or because I quit the meds that I don't think I need. They all say I'm bipolar and give me these bullshit placebo pills that have hardly done anything. I seriously doubt I am, and so I quit the meds that I don't need. I don't experience the very common triggers, nor do I experience the physiological and emotional extremes associated with that disorder. It's all a misdiagnosis. I know it. I don't care if three doctors agreed with it, it's all wrong. These are the wrong meds and they are going to ruin me.

The thoughts came back. I keep going through almost cyclical periods of wanting to go through with a gender transition, only to completely lose interest weeks or months later. I don't know which side to trust. I was going through treatment for it, but I ended up quitting for some stupid fucking reason. Now it's flaring up again. When it flares up now, it flares up to an EXTREME extent. I can't make rational decisions, my emotions are very unstable, and I become suicidal and engage in self-harm. These periods can last from a week to a few months. I don't understand why it's so intense. I literally cannot focus on ANYTHING else besides the idea of transitioning. The thoughts plague me night and day. It haunts me in my sleep. I'm afraid to go to sleep now. I just can't do it. I don't want this to be any worse. It will only get worse as long as it's not being treated.

I'm almost certain this is going to get worse and it's only the first day of this 'flare-up'. I'm in an incredible amount of distress right now. The suicidal thoughts are starting to come back. I can't relax and breathe. I can't get anything done. It's transition or die. There is no other option.

I won't be able to transition in the near future. By then the treatment will have a minimized effect on me. I was fine before this two years ago. It worked. I was fine. Then I wasn't. I'm fucking done with this shit. I'm done. I want to end it. I don't give a shit about anything else at this point. I don't even know how to do it since anything I could use has been removed from the house after previous attempts. But I know I'll find a way if this gets worse. I don't know where this is going to go and I'm kind of scared. I don't want to end up back in the psych ward.

It's not just this stupid transgender crap that's fueling this. I also have a bunch of other psychiatric problems that are keeping me from getting anywhere in life. My therapist even told me that out of all her patients I have the most problems. Thanks doc. I'm told I shouldn't expect to be able to sustain a real 9-5 job that pays well. It's either part-time min wage servitude or disability. Either way I won't be able to pursue the gender transition. This leaves me with no choice. It's going to end soon. ",suicide

499,"It feels like it's creeping up on me, not sure how much longer I can go on with it.It's been exactly a month since my mother died at the age of 51. I always considered myself to not have to worry about the scenario until I was in my 30's, but here I am dealing with it at the age of 19. I've been criticized and pointed out at how well I'm coping with all of this happening for me, but deep down inside I'm hurt like the rest of them, I'm just desensitized from all the quarrels, problems, and depression leading up to it, not to mention nightmares almost every single night since then.

It used to be just my mother, myself, and my brother all living together. My father left because of a relationship dispute some time ago when I was younger, but he has still been there for me. But since this has all happened, it has felt like nothing but control over the situation. He doesn't want to support me and my brother financially while he's the only one with a job right now, and he can't support us socially because he lives in another city. The most he's done is tell us to get a job and start manning up to the responsibilities that my mother used to take care of, but to be fair, neither me or my brother have had the willpower to do anything since. I want to go and see a grievance counselor with my brother, but procrastination, depression, and anxiety has been getting the better of both of us, and I doubt my father would be willing to help in that regard.

I feel really broken right now. Unable to work and keep up in today's society. Everyone's pushing us forward, telling us what to do, how to do, what we need. I feel it's only a matter of time before either me or my brother hatches an idea and it plays out like some sort of dramatic movie. I asked my brother today how is he feeling today, on a scale from 0 being like any other day, to 10 being that he knows today is his last. He replied 8, I replied 6, although that's probably just the desensitization talking, and I'm probably more closer to 8 or 9.

I feel like this is all revolving around money. It doesn't feel right at all, especially considering that my mother used to get paid spousal support, and she'd spend that money on me and my brother. It now goes all back to my dad and haven't seen anything since. I've tried speaking up against my dad about this, but the most he does is hold what little he supports us on right now over our heads and asks if we want his support or not.

I don't know what to do anymore. I don't know how to live. I definitely don't know how to help myself. A lot of these things, I would have asked my mother to hold my hand and help me do them.

I've been lurking here on my main for a long time, and I don't know that I fit in. I'm sorry if my situation isn't relatable. It sounds really stupid.

I have a great life. I know many people are alone but I'm not, no matter how much I keep trying to be. I try to push my friends and family away but I can't. I had a pretty traumatic childhood, but all those people have been out of my life for a decade and my remaining family are amazing.

Suicide is absolutely not an option for me. I have too many people who care about me (I know, I know how this sounds). Once my dad and grandma pass away, then it's very much on the table - friends and other relatives may be sad but they will get over it. However, my dad was a young parent and therefore is very young and healthy, I've got a couple decades before that becomes a reality. Sometimes I resent that, and that's the darkest thought I've ever had. I've never told anyone this before, but in my worst moments I am upset that my dad - my favorite person in the *world* \- is still alive and healthy and going to stay that way, because that means I have to stay alive for a few more decades too, and I really don't want to.

I'm also gainfully employed, in a job I used to love, and really should still love. I'm not wealthy but I can support myself. My job is incredibly stressful but my coworkers are good people, my boss is a good person, I believe in the work, and it pays the bills even in my very expensive city.

I have friends, and the ability to have more friends, but instead of going out and socializing I just keep pushing more and more people away.

I just don't know where to go from here. I feel like I have to keep it all up - working, being a normal person, or faking it as best as possible. I isolate myself a lot, I never go out, but still my friends are there. It's very weird and confusing. I don't know how I got so lucky. Not only are my friends still around no matter how much I avoid them, but they're all very cool people - they're intelligent and successful and have so much going for them in their lives. I don't know how I've tricked all these people into being my friends, or how I've tricked my job into keeping me employed, or how I've tricked my family into being so supportive. But I have, and I need to undo all of this without hurting anyone.

I don't want to be alive anymore. Every time a minor thing goes wrong that thought hits me like a ton of bricks. Every time I'm alone, and I'm alone *a lot,* all the same. But I don't know what to do. I feel so fucking trapped. But my amazing, supportive friends and family would be absolutely crushed if I told them any of this - and they'd probably have me committed. They'd probably try to make me quit my stressful job, as most of my complaints about life to them are framed around my job (which is stressful, yeah, but a mentally healthy person could handle this - hell, even a slightly-more-healthy version of me from a few years ago could handle it). Then I'd have nowhere to go, nothing to do. My friends and family would get tired of me and I'd be in the same situation as so many people who are alone.

It's like I've got it backwards. I have no reason to be depressed right now, but I am, cripplingly so. But if I tell anyone, my life will be turned upside down and I'll have a genuine reason to want to die for the first time since I was 12.

I just... don't know where to go from here. I'm sorry if this was rambling and hard to follow. And I'm sorry if this sounds self involved or bragging - I don't understand why I've gotten so unfairly lucky in life, either. I wish someone more whole had all these good things going from them. I would genuinely love it if nobody would miss me. I know that sounds awful.",suicide

529,"I'm finally at a breaking pointI have no idea why I am writing this right now. I'm 29 and I'm a fucking loser. I'm a miserable person who sees all the negatives in any situation. I've fucked up every opportunity life has ever given me. Everything to me seems stupid and pointless and I can't seem to find enjoyment out of anything that doesn't involve deep fantasy where I can forget who I am for brief periods of time.

My parents sent me to two different schools and I fucked up each of them for years and got no degree. I have no real skills that can get me a job, I've been unemployed for two years straight almost. I finally got a job four months ago and got so stressed out at a night time security guard job that I had to quit it was making me so incredibly miserable. I'm pathetic and I have no idea why I was feeling what I was feeling. I can't put it into words, I'd just go to the job and start to feel panicked. I ended up having to find an excuse to quit even though my parents asked me not to.

Now I'm sitting here jobless wondering what do I do? Even if I get a job is it going to stress me out to the point where I can't handle it? Probably. My father thinks I'm a fucking loser and a disappointment even if he won't come right out and say it. He's ashamed of me and that crushes me, but there's nothing I can do. Shame is something I've come used to, it scares me less than the stress I am going through.

I've never had a girlfriend, I've never really kissed a girl, I've never had anyone love me back. I've never had someone I could put my arm around and say ""I love you too"" to me. I live completely alone without another living soul around me. I didn't used to drink until I started that job four months ago and now I do it just to feel 'normal'. Like just doing what everyone else does when their depressed makes me feel slightly better.

I've been laying completely in the dark for hours crying because I have no hope for the future. I'm almost 30 years old and there's nothing good out there coming. I've squandered every opportunity I've been given and it's just too late. I'm a burden to everyone around me. I tried to tell my parents how I felt around the holidays but they didn't get it. They were worried for a few days and kept asking me over and over how I felt until I finally said 'better' and then they figured I was past it all. I wasn't.

They told me I need to talk to someone, but I can't afford to go talk to a professional. And even if I did, where do I start? How does a professional take my fucked up life and make me want to live it? There's no digging myself out of this hole I'm in. I'm stuck and I'm going to stay stuck. It's too late for me to start changing, too late for me to get a girl, too late for me to fix how I get when I go in public. So fuck it, right?

I'm crying and screaming at the top of my lungs and I just don't know how to make it all stop. I don't know why I'm putting this in the suicide watch Reddit because I'm too much of a coward to kill myself. I want to do it, but I'm too afraid. I've tried before, but I always chicken out. I'm useless even at that.

Again, I just don't know why I'm writing all this. I'm somewhat of a writer, maybe I'm hoping it'll make me feel better? I was wrong. Now I just feel embarassed ontop of it. Jesus, what do I do? Do I keep limping along, making people ashamed of me as I keep fucking everything up? Wouldn't it be BETTER for me to just end it? ",suicide

She kept it to herself for 2 years thinking she could change the way she feels about me. When she was a child/teen she was abused sexually by older men and now that is all she is attracted to. She did not expect to fall in love with me when we started dating. I wanted to get married someday. NEVER felt this way about anyone before. Now she is gone. She told me that maybe we could try again but that she would need to make a big change in her life and isn't sure that it would ever happen. Seems like she doesnt want anything to do with me and she said its because it would be to hard for her and me to be in my life. I am going crazy dealing with this. Eating sleeping and getting work done are very difficult. I try to not call her or text her but I usually cave and do it at least once a day. I go by her work and new place to see if shes there at night when I can't sleep. Im really fucked up. I am 2 years sober as well which makes this harder. I cant run from the pain i get to feel everything. I think about killing myself. I just feel like its all getting worse and I cant change it. When I was trying to get sober I thought about killing myself a lot for the same reason. All this work to do and no energy. Ive come to the conclusion that doing work, whether for money or personal growth is the way to being ol and somewhat of a whole person but I just dont know how. I have all this work to do and I dont have the energy or give a shit enough about anything to get started. I know objectively what is supposed to work.

534,"My chronic depression is getting worse... This world feels like a nightmare. [NSFL]I'm thinking about suicide a lot...

I want to be dead. I once thought that human problems were surmountable, but they're not.

They're just not. I only want to live if I can think of a scheme in which humans aren't doomed, and I can't. I've tried and I can't, and that depresses me. Everyone I've ever loved is going to die; I'm going to die. Everyone works hard for things, which they forget about when they die. Everyone feels pain. There's so much agony in the world. So much madness. Small animals by the millions are being poured into grinders alive; their meat comes flowing out a tube, like shit from an anus. Young children are beheading people, but tiny baby arms are so weak they saw the heads off slowly. And then other children listen to music that's merely people screaming. Screaming! This is a world of endless screaming. High-school graduations happen, and the young men and women without scholarships walk away, knowing that they will live lives of struggle, which will be harvested as tax dollars for the state, no differently than the way human batteries are harvested by the machines of The Matrix. The planet is suffering and the minds able to come up with schemes capable of reversing the damage being done are killing themselves. The leaders we elect have values, not plans or schemes. Human history is filled with torture, slavery, and suffering. I hate being human. Most of my friends are depressed because I find happiness intolerable: pathological happiness in the face of this worlds past, present, and future, seems like a crime to me. Every religion secretly prescribes nihilism. Humans exploit one another in life, because nature has been overridden by the state, thanks to human nature. And I feel worlds away from it all. I don't want to participate in human affairs, but go in direction completely opposite to wherever this leads. I don't have any hope for humans... I just hope... That this is all some kind of simulation, intended to teach me how not to behave. What if evolution made us miserable, so we could survive? I don't feel like anyone can relate to me. I don't feel human. I don't understand what I'm supposed to do for you. I don't understand why, as I've aged, I've become more sensitive, and not less. The adults who raised me were so stupid, that I assumed I would become numb when I grew old, but it seems like the complete opposite has happened. These feelings. Was I programmed to function in a smaller world? I drive down the street, and it scares me: that I have this urge to meet everybody I see, but I roll past them like they're nothing. And I'm nothing too. What's the point in being a nothing that feels something? And there's no such thing as help. People don't help; they help themselves by getting jobs. One of my only older friends, she's really jaded about life; she feels like it let her down. She told me that I should try not to obsess over these things (our world and universe is eating itself); that people who do, do end up killing themselves. I just can't though. It's getting harder and harder to wake up in the morning, and when I do wake up I'll go back to bed to cover up my disgusting self. I will delete this post, to cover up my disgusting self, but I promise I won't kill myself. I feel so torn, because I want to like existence, but I don't. And it's the only existence I know! And that hurts even more.

I know its probably PPD and PPA but to be fucking honest, I dont care WHAT it is. All I know is I want it to stop. I dont enjoy being a mother. I got pregnant at 19. Just recently had my 21st bday. So I'm a young mom. I kept the baby because I thought I was going to be a good mom. I've worked at daycares. I've always been good w kids. I always wanted to be a mother. And I LOVE my baby, with all my heart, but I'm just not a good mom. I hate not being able to do anything anymore. Always broke. Cant even shit on my own time. I dont sleep. My baby is 9 mo old and still wakes up up to 8 times a night. I dont like my appearance. I don't like sitting home all day. I dont like the sound of my baby crying. I don't like changing 10000 diapers a day. I don't like not being able to do ANYTHING when I want to. I miss independence. Freedom. Having a personality other than tired and stressed. Friends. Going out. Relaxing. Having goals and hopes for my future. Lmao, all the goals I had are gone now. Cant go to college when all your money is being spent on formula. Cant go to college when you dont have a babysitter. Cant get a good job without college. Etc etc etc. I'll amount to nothing more than a mother now. And for some people that's enough. But I feel like I may as well be 50 already, just say bye to any semblance of youth i have. I don't think its right to my daughter to have a mom who doesnt wanna be here. I don't think it's fair to my boyfriend to have to deal with me. I will NEVER be happy away from her so leaving and starting over isnt an option. Cant undo my baby in my brain. But I will never be happy doing this either. I just want to quit. I want to die. I want her to have a better mom. I want her to not see anger from her mother. I want to not be conscious or aware anymore. I want to cease to be. But I'm terrified I'll do it and get stuck on the other side watching her from afar. If I knew 100 percent death meant emptiness and conciousness death, I'd have done it long before now. And I've struggled w depression, bi polar, borderline personality, my whole life.

All the parties and activities I'm welcome at, are full of old people (as in at least 40 y/o).

I was so glad that I got invited to celebrate the newyear at my boyfriend's appartment, but yesterday the flu kicked in. I was up the whole night (8pm till 5am) vomiting bile and it hurt so much that i even had to sleep sitting up. It was horrible.

He'll maybe come later tonight, around 11pm, just to fuck obviously.

557,"I'm a Worthless BastardToday, I really contemplated killing myself. It’s not the first time. I’ve considered it a lot of times in my life and I always come up with some reason not to. My family needs me too much. I’d miss the new episode of my favorite show. For the longest time, the reason I was holding onto was that I didn’t want to miss out on Avengers Infinity War and then Endgame. It sounds so stupid now that I think about it. Then I saw it and, even though it wasn’t everything I thought it was going to be, I was mostly satisfied, and I forgot. It had been so long that I had forgotten that I was waiting for that movie to end things.

It wasn’t until today when I was sitting on the couch, at peace for once. I was genuinely content with myself at that moment. Then my sister came, and she was mad that I didn’t take her son to school today. He didn’t get a lot of sleep last night, had a really bad nightmare about his grandmother (on his father's side) who had recently passed. I decided to let him stay home since it wouldn’t be right to send him to school. My sister confronted me. She accused me of being lazy. She said that all I do is lay around and watch tv all the time. She brought up things; how I’d never finished school, how I didn’t have a job, how I didn’t have any friends, and that the only thing I had in this world was those stupid action figures that I collected. She called me a Worthless Bastard and said that I was going to grow old with nothing and that I better not expect her to take care of me when our mother eventually dies.

A worthless bastard. That really hurt. She thinks that I am a worthless bastard. My own sister. I waited until she left the house and then I cried. I really got to thinking about my life.

She's right. I don't have any friends. I dropped out of college to take care of my mom when she got sick and now I don't have a degree. I'm 23 and still a virgin. I've never even had a boyfriend cause no one ever wanted to ask me out. I was a home care provider for my mom but then I was fired when she changed insurances. No Job. No money. I fill out an application for places and get rejected. I go in for interviews and get rejected. I'm so tired of getting rejected.

I just hate my life. I hate everything about it. Every time I leave the house I just feel like everyone is laughing at me. They can all see how awful I am and are thinking about how much they hate me. I know I'm being irrational. It's just how I feel so I haven't left the house, other than to drop my nephew off at school and pick him up, in days and even then I don't get out of the car that way I don't have to face anyone. I just go home and hide.

I used to be so Smart. I think about how Smart I used to be. I think about my goals. My plans for my life. The things that I wanted to do. I was going to be a doctor. I was going to go to college out of state and It was my plan and I’d tell anyone who would listen about my plans.

I endured a lot of bullying growing up and people were always telling me that I was worthless. I was always going to be worthless. I remember in the first grade that I was excluded from games and I didn’t have any friends. The Bullying continued throughout Elementary and Middle School. Bullied at school and then bullied at home by my sister and my grandmother. All my life everyone has always told me that I was ugly. that I was stupid. That I was lazy. That I couldn't do anything right. That I was a dumbass. And whenever I'd cry I was called out for being sensitive. Why was I so sensitive? Why couldn’t I take a joke?  I was always a target, and there were days when I considered killing myself just for relief. But I didn’t. I stood in front of a mirror, tears in my eyes and I said, “Not yet. I can’t do that to my family.”

But I think about it now that I’m older. All my life, I was told that I had to take care of my sister. She has a mental disorder and my mom was always telling me that one day when I became a doctor that I had to support my sister. Look after her. I used to have nightmares about that. Nightmares where my mom was a ghost telling me to look after my sister. And after she had my nephew it became, ""Look after both of them.""

Now, I'm nothing. I didn't become anything. I didn't prove anyone wrong. I can't take care of anyone. I'm a waste of space. A worthless Bastard just like she said. I feel so worthless and tired. I hate myself so much. I just wish I was dead.",suicide
561,"Confusion, suicide and a sick petI’ve been having a lot of suicidal ideation. It’s different this time though because I truly feel I’m not meant to be on this plane in existence. I finally realize that waiting out this pain is rather pointless because it’s going to re-emerge again and whatever contentment I find in the spaces between isn’t worth the darkness. I manic-depressive and I can’t trust my own brain, my mind. It’s the worst it’s ever been this time.

My cat stopped eating about a week ago. He’s going downhill and the doctors just figured out what’s going on but the situation is dire it’s probably too late. I don’t know what to do. Supposedly he has a 79% chance of bouncing back, but in the meantime he’s on a feeding tube that I have to tend to every hour and a half. And any other time in my life, I would jump on the chance to help my companion animal get through a hump like this to live. But right now, well I’m suicidal, I don’t know why am torturing him and torturing me in the process.

The vet said it’s not torture. That he looks worse than he is. I’m not concerned that this vet is bilking me for money, believe me. He really thinks that if we do the tube feeding for about a week that he could be fine for another three, or five, or 10 years. But I don’t want to be here another three, or five, or 10 years. I feel horrible that instead of snuggling with me like he’s always done, my cat Stays in one spot unless I’m coming to feed him and in that case he runs away. Like bolts away for me, running into things along the way because he has the Elizabethan collar on.

I don’t know if it’s good for him or me to keep doing this. I don’t know if I put him down, I might come to me angry that I didn’t do everything I could. And I don’t know if that outweighs the anger I’m going to feel if he is deteriorating to a point of no return and his last days with me are horrible.

I fantasize about killing me and him. Why delay the inevitable? This pain isn’t worth it. We could be released from everything.

576,"She left again. Tonight's the night I'm done.
I'm killing myself tonight because I have literally no reason to be here anymore. I'm fed up with everything, the girl I've known for two years has been a blessing, she's been a crutch for me when I've needed it, she's helped me through everything and I've helped her.
I've made my share of fuck ups, so of course to her parents I'm the crazy ex who they despise and want nothing to do with.

Yet she's always let me back in, she's always made my heart beat in a way that I never thought it could. She's made the coldest nights warm, and the most painful of injuries turn numb. But she lies. A lot. And I forgive her, I let her in, hell I let her walk all over me but she will suddenly claim one day a week that she wants nothing to do with me. This is how it's always been.

But this week pretty much ended it all for good. Her dad got involved and all kinds of shit (even though we're both 19, yet her parents need to control her life.)

So I'm left here alone, without even the utterance of a goodbye from the woman I've spent the last two years on. Trying to help her beat the battle of depression that I haven't even beaten myself. Tonight the war was lost. I'll send a link of this to her so maybe she can read it. Not that it matters, I've made this up before, but I'm truly going through with it tonight. I'm gonna smoke, then go for a walk, and never look back. Probably won't make it through the night. I love you..if you're reading this. It's not your fault, you've been the reason I've made it to this age. I would've given up before if it weren't for you. I hope you can find happiness, I know I did.

I no longer feel pain,remorse,grief, anger, or anything. I've gone numb. I've given up. All that I really want now is to experience that pure calm of eternal nothingness. ",suicide

583,"Help with SO who is suicidalHi guys, I am in a tough place right now.

Quick background on me: I have moderate-severe clinical depression. Earlier this year I went to the ER twice for suicidal ideation; before that I had stopped eating and sleeping for three days at a time. I self-harmed every day. My symptoms are *completely managed* by now with meds and therapy and I no longer have suicidal thoughts.

I just started dating someone (trans nonbinary, assigned female at birth) who has depression and suicidal thoughts that don't enter the planning/methods level of detail, which is good.

I am struggling because my SO refuses to consider medication for reasons that aren't medically accurate, and relies on me to be their ""antidepressant."" (I make them feel good when we see each other.) Obviously, I understand how awful depression is and knew that going into this relationship, but my SO's refusal to get medical care for their depression/using me to make themselves feel better is really starting to take a toll on my own mental health.

They got upset at me (over text) when I said I couldn't meet this weekend because I have midterms this next week (I am in a very involved premed program).

They live about 90 minutes away, so most of our communication is via text/video calls. A couple nights ago we had this exchange:

SO: I want to die

me: Do you think you're going to hurt yourself tonight?

SO: I'm already hurting myself

me (at this point, shaking because I am upset and afraid they're attempting suicide/self-harming): How?

SO: I'm trying to write an essay, I can't type both.

A similar scenario has gone down a couple times; my SO saying they want to die/""end my suffering""/""end me"" and then when I try to figure out what's going on, I'm called a ""nerd"" or told ""stop worrying about me"" (harshly) or even just ignored. One time, they said they wanted to kill themselves, I responded saying something like, there are other ways to make the pain get better, what can I do for you, and was met with ""what are you going to do if I kill myself, spank me?""

That message honestly made me sick to my stomach.

I really care about this person but this is taking a serious toll on me. I understand what it's like to be in that dark, awful place but I feel like I'm being played with, especially with the suicidal comments that, when I inquire about them, I am met with sarcasm or teasing. It is hurting me. I have had the urge to self harm multiple times since I got into this relationship and have had to ban myself from going to certain places where I could obtain the means to do so.

What should I do, you guys? I don’t know what is going on, I don’t know if my SO is being serious or messing with me, I don’t know how worried I need to be if their thoughts never enter the planning stage, and I don’t know if I should stay with them if this continues—not because they have depression, but because they won’t address it, against the advice of numerous medical professionals.
We’ve only been together a month. I really like them and am willing to be there for support, but I’m not an antidepressant. I’m a person with needs and a history of severe depression. I really don’t want to fall back into hurting myself. Please help me figure out how to navigate this.

Anyways, I admire his courage.  I am far too afraid to kill myself, even though I know I should.

I'm bitter that this person is getting so much attention on social media, so much *affection* on social media.  I'm jealous.  I want a modicum of that affection.

And yet I know that if I got it, it wouldn't matter because I'll only accept it if it comes from certain people, the ones I seemingly arbitrarily decided to declare ""important"".

I deserve to die and yet I live.  When I'm gone I know no one will mourn the same way for me.

My wife and I are splitting up. Its because of years of me choosing weed over my family like my sons birthday, my anniversary, all of it... It's all my fault. The women that I spent 5 years of my life married too, had a wonderful unbelievably amazing daughter and son with.. Idk how to do this.

All I want is to kill myself. I don't want to think about.. splitting up material bullshit.. or .. fuck man.. or even how we're suppose to talk to each other now. I'm madly in love with this woman but.. somehow it wasn't enough to overcome my own selfishness. I've ruined the only thing I've ever wanted, a real family. I don't know where I'm suppose to go.. how do I drive now that I'm leaving her with the car, the bills, the kids, my heart, fuck... everything is with this woman. I couldn't stand to see her happy with someone else, but I do wish her nothing but happiness. I just.. she's been kissing me and I was just told its because I want it. She doesn't even want to kiss me. I really fucked up. I don't know where to go from here. I don't know if I want more than what I've already taken in this life. I've struggled with chronic depression and suicidal thoughts my entire life, and right when I think that I'm finally over it.. this happens. I am the bad guy here. I know I am and no matter how many tears I cry it'll never fix what I once had.

If I'm not going to kill myself, then I need to know how to do this. She works 40 hours during the week on days, and I work 2 12's on saturday and sunday so money isn't exactly easy to come by. What about my babies.. how does the mother of my children sustain their living situation and her own without me around to watch them while she works. I'm sure she'll find a way.
